# Metadata Constrains for EJP rare disease catalogs as a use case 


#Example: 
The RDF data about a catalog must provide some common metadata, so there is need to verify if every catalog record in the graph reports a valid metadata e.g. reports a valid catalog ID, alternativeName, description, homepage and location of the catalog, as identified by the IRI.  The ShEx schema to accomplish this has the following constrains: 
1. Catalog:id             #to match node with IRI 
2. Catalog:alternateName  #match with string
3. Catalog:description    #match with string
4. Catalog:homepage       #match with url
5. Catalog:location       #match with string


#The node constrain: 

1. Catalog:id             xsd:string
2. Catalog:alternateName  xsd:string
3. Catalog:description    xsd:string
4. Catalog:homepage       xsd:string
5. Catalog:location       xsd:string
